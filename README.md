milestone 2- In this task, we are going to create a list of words.
Creating a list containing the names of my 5 favorite fruits.
Assigning this list to a variable called word_list.
Printing out the newly created list to the standard output (screen).

milestone_3
Writing import random on the line. 
Creating the random.choice method and passing the word_list variable into the choice method.
Assigning the randomly generated word to a variable called word.
Print out word to the standard output. Run the code several times and observe the words printed out after each run.

milestone_4
Using the input function, we ask the user to enter a single letter.
Assigning the input to a variable called guess.
Usually, when taking input from users, it is best to validate that the input makes sense, creating conditional checks that must be passed before the input can be accepted.

milestone_5
Creating an if statement that checks if the length of the input is equal to 1 and the input is alphabetical.
In the body of the if statement, we will print a message that says "Good guess!".
Creating an else block that prints "Oops! That is not a valid input." if the preceding conditions are not met.
